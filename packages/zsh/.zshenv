# Local Environment
#=============================================================================
# Here rather than conf.d for the same reason as PATH above. conf.d only loads
# from .zshrc, so a key set there exists for interactive shells and nothing
# else. Scheduled jobs, agent routines and git hooks all run non-interactively
# and saw nothing, which reads at the far end as "not authenticated" rather
# than as a config bug.
#
# ~/.env uses explicit `export` per line, so no `set -a` here — a blanket
# auto-export would push every future entry into every child process.
#
# Sourced after PATH so entries can reference the binaries it adds.
